    </body>
    There was once upon a time a king and a queen who were so very, very sorry at not having children, that it is impossible to express how sorry they were.
    After the baptismal ceremony, the company returned to the king's palace, where there was a grand banquet for the fairies. Before each of them was put a magnificient dish, and a massive golden case, in whic was a knife, fork and spoon of fine gold, set with diamonds and rubies. But, as they were taking their places at table, an old fairy was seen to enter the room who had not been asked to the wedding, because it was more than fifty years since she had quit her tower, and she was believed to be dead.
